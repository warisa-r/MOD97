# MOD97

This program can only check IBAN of 3 countries as I do not include the length check of all the IBAN around the world.
The countries aforementioned are Germany, Belgium, and Austria.

However, it can be easily modified in function check_length to check IBAN validity of any other country if the number of the digit that the IBANs of a certain country is given.
